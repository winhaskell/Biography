Kurt Gödel

Kurt Friedrich Gödel (April 28, 1906 – January 14, 1978) was a logician, mathematician, and philosopher. 
Considered along with Aristotle and Gottlob Frege to be one of the most significant logicians in history,
Gödel profoundly influenced scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century (at a time when Bertrand Russell,
Alfred North Whitehead,and David Hilbert were using logic and set theory to investigate the foundations of mathematics),
building on earlier work by Richard Dedekind, Georg Cantor and Gottlob Frege.

Gödel also showed that neither the axiom of choice nor the continuum hypothesis can be disproved from the accepted
Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, assuming that its axioms are consistent. The former result opened the door for mathematicians 
to assume the axiom of choice in their proofs. He also made important contributions to proof theory by clarifying the
connections between classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and modal logic.
