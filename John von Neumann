John von Neumann 

John von Neumann (/vɒn ˈnɔɪmən/ von NOY-mən; Hungarian: Neumann János Lajos; December 28, 1903 – February 8, 1957) was 
a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, engineer and polymath. 
He had perhaps the widest coverage of any mathematician of his time,[9] integrating pure and applied sciences and making
major contributions to many fields, including mathematics, physics, economics, computing, and statistics.
He was a pioneer in building the mathematical framework of quantum physics, in the development of functional analysis, 
and in game theory, introducing or codifying concepts including cellular automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer. 
His analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA.
