John von Neumann 

John von Neumann (/vɒn ˈnɔɪmən/ von NOY-mən; Hungarian: Neumann János Lajos; December 28, 1903 – February 8, 1957) was 
a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, engineer and polymath. 
He had perhaps the widest coverage of any mathematician of his time,[9] integrating pure and applied sciences and making
major contributions to many fields, including mathematics, physics, economics, computing, and statistics.
He was a pioneer in building the mathematical framework of quantum physics, in the development of functional analysis, 
and in game theory, introducing or codifying concepts including cellular automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer. 
His analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA.

John von Neumann (born December 28, 1903, Budapest, Hungary—died February 8, 1957, Washington, D.C., U.S.) Hungarian-born American mathematician. 
As an adult, he appended von to his surname; the hereditary title had been granted his father in 1913.

Von Neumann grew from child prodigy to one of the world’s foremost mathematicians by his mid-twenties. 
Important work in set theory inaugurated a career that touched nearly every major branch of mathematics.

Von Neumann’s gift for applied mathematics took his work in directions that influenced quantum theory, 
automata theory, economics, and defense planning. Von Neumann pioneered game theory and, along with 
Alan Turing and Claude Shannon, was one of the conceptual inventors of the stored-program digital computer.
