Pyotr Kapitsa 

Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa or Peter Kapitza FRS (Russian: Пётр Леонидович Капица, 8 July 1894 – 8 April 1984) 
was a leading Soviet physicist and Nobel laureate, whose research focused on low-temperature physics.

Immediately after the war, a group of prominent Soviet scientists (including Kapitsa in particular) lobbied the government
to create a new technical university, the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Kapitsa taught there for many years. 
From 1957, he was also a member of the presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and at his death in 1984 was the only 
presidium member who was not also a member of the Communist Party.

In 1978, Kapitsa won the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his basic inventions and discoveries in the area of low-temperature physics" and 
was also cited for his long term role as a leader in the development of this area. 
He shared the prize with Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson, who won for discovering the cosmic microwave background.

Kapitsa resistance is the thermal resistance (which causes a temperature discontinuity) at the interface between liquid helium and a solid. 
The Kapitsa–Dirac effect is a quantum mechanical effect consisting of the diffraction of electrons by a standing wave of light. 
In fluid dynamics, the Kapitza number is a dimensionless number characterizing the flow of thin films of fluid down an incline.
