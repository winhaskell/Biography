James Harris Simons (April 25, 1938 â€“ May 10, 2024) was an American hedge fund manager, mathematician, and philanthropist.
He was the founder of Renaissance Technologies, a quantitative hedge fund based in East Setauket, New York. 
He and his fund are known to be quantitative investors, using mathematical models and algorithms to make investment gains
from market inefficiencies. Due to the long-term aggregate investment returns of Renaissance and its Medallion Fund, 
Simons was described as the "greatest investor on Wall Street," and more specifically "the most successful hedge fund manager of all time".

Jim was a giant in mind, soul, and personality. With an undergraduate degree from MIT and PhD from UC Berkeley, 
Jim went on to become chair of the math department at Stony Brook, where he made great strides in topology, string theory, and condensed matter physics. 

He went on to pioneer the field of quantitative trading, and founded one of the most profitable investment firms in history, Renaissance Technologies.
Later in life,Jim turned his focus toward making a difference in the world, with far-reaching philanthropic investments through 
the Simons Foundation, Simons Foundation International, and Math for America.

Simons was a major benefactor of his graduate alma mater, Berkeley. On July 1, 2012, the Simons Foundation pledged $60 million to Berkeley 
to establish the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, the world's leading institute for collaborative research in theoretical computer science.

In 2016, the International Astronomical Union named asteroid 6618 Jimsimons, which Clyde Tombaugh discovered in 1936,
after Simons in honor of his contributions to mathematics and philanthropy.
